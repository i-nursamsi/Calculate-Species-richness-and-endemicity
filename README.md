This tool calculates three key biodiversity metrics - species richness, weighted endemism, and corrected weighted endemism - using input occurrence point data. Metrics are evaluated for tessellated hexagons, created using the 'Create Tessellated Hexagons' function in the basic Shapefile and CSV tools.

Species richness (SR) is calculated as the total number of species (K) in a grid cell.

Weighted Endemism (WE) sums the reciprocals of the total number of cells each species in a grid cell appears in, emphasizing areas with a high proportion of range-restricted species.

Corrected Weighted Endemism (CWE) is the weighted endemism divided by the total species count (K) in a cell, highlighting areas rich in range-restricted species, irrespective of the overall species count.
